Allocating common costs to 6 individuals.

We like fishing.
We do it every year, minimum 2 times a year.
During time to be together everyone pays for something. What you pay for the community and by the end wanting to be accounted for, is put into a list with their item name along with the amount. The application calculates the total cost, distributes it equally among the people and specifies who needs to make additional payments or get back money. In the end, a detailed invoice is created that can be sent to everyone.

The persons participate with their photos.
